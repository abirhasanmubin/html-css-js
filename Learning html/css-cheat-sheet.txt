Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level 
it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element, element => different elements with same style
element1 element2 => element2 inside another element1
element1 > element2 => element2 is a child of element1
element1 + element2 => element2 is just after element1
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended) it is used as default


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
